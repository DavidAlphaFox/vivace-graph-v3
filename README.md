VivaceGraph
===============

VivaceGraph is an open source graph database written in pure Common Lisp.

VG takes design inspiration from CouchDB, neo4j and AllegroGraph.  It implements an ACID-compliant object graph model with user-defined indexes and map-reduce views.  It also implements a master / slave replication scheme for redundancy and horizontal read scaling.  Querying the graph is accomplished via a number of Lisp methods or via a Prolog-like query language.
